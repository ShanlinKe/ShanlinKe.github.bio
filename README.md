# Bio
I am a biologist by training, with expertise in bioinformatics and microbiology, machine learning, and animal experiments. My long-term research interests involve investigating the human microbiome that contributes to the development of human disease, including C.difficile infection, PTSD, COVID-19, aging, and IBD.
